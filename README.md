# StatLearningBigData_FinalProject

Final Project for Brown University's Statistical Learning and Big Data course in Spring 2021, taught by Dr. Alice Paul

# Goal

This project summarized the work done on four separate assignments regaurding EDA and Computational Tools, PCA and Clustering, SVM and Trees  and Deep Learning. The data set chosen for this project was the Hotel Booking Data Set published by Nuno Antonio, Ana de Almeida and Luis Nunes. This data set features booking information for 119k hotel reservations. The data was gathered directly from hotel property management system databases using SQL Server Studio Manager, and contains 32 attributes. The question that motivates this data set is whether or not certain booking features can be used to predict whether a booking will be canceled or not.
